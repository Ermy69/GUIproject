GUI Project
Calculator & Currency 
Converter
In this README file, we will take you through our projects: GUI Calculator and Money Prevalence, program using Python.
We will also show you how to develop  simple programs using tkinter module.

There are many great projects available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life 
Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!!
